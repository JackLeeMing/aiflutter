# Fix type mismatch error in code (2025-08-24 09:54Z)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
The argument type 'CardTheme' can't be assigned to the parameter type 'CardThemeData?'. 
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

I can see the issue in your code. The error occurs because you're using `CardTheme` instead of `CardThemeData` for the `cardTheme` property in your `ThemeData`.

Let me fix this for you:

```

The fix is simple: change `CardTheme` to `CardThemeData` on line 154. In Flutter's `ThemeData`, the `cardTheme` property expects a `CardThemeData` object, not a `CardTheme` widget.

The error should now be resolved. `CardThemeData` is the correct data class used for theming Card widgets within a `ThemeData` configuration.
